HPASubC, v1.0 08/03/2014
==============
The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) Subclassification (SubC) software package is a collection of python scripts by Marc Halushka and Toby Cornish at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. This is free software in the public space. This suite of scripts has not been made in conjunction with the HPA, thus the HPA is in no way responsible for any data obtained through these methods. No warranties are given or implied.

get_image_urls_from_gene_list.py
--------------
usage: get_image_urls_from_gene_list.py <input_file> <output_file> <tissue>

For a list of gene ids and a tissue type, this script will parse the HPA results, extract all image URLs, and output a list of .jpg image urls.  This file requires a .txt input file of ENSG IDs. These can be obtained here: http://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download.

<input_file>: A txt file list of ENGS IDs without a header in the style of: 
ENSG00000000003
ENSG00000000005
ENSG00000000419

<output_file>: A CSV file with four columns - protein ID, tissue, protein URL and image URL.  This output file is used as input for image_download.py.

<tissue>: A valid tissue type recognized by the HPA website. A list of known tissue types are given in Appendix A of this file. If there are spaces in the tissue name, enclose the whole name in double quotes, for example:
"cardiac muscle"


image_download.py
--------------
usage: image_download.py <input_file> <output_folder>

This script will download the full-sized HPA images from the .csv file generated by get_image_urls_from_gene_list.py

<input_file>: A CSV file generated by get_image_urls_from_gene_list.py. The file includes a column of image urls, and some additional columns of information. 

<output_folder>: A folder to contain the downloaded JPEG images.  It will be created if it does not exist. 


image_viewer.py
--------------
usage: image_viewer.py <input_dir> <output_file>

This script will open all of the image files within a folder and allow them to be quickly scanned for any staining pattern of interest.  Any image file that can be opened by PyGame can be used, but the extension will need to be added to the imageExtensions list to be recognized. By default, only JPEGs are recognized. Either the keyboard or a PyGame-compatible USB gamepad/joystick can be used (finally, a legitimate reason to have a video game controller on your desk at work).  

The gamepad/joystick left and right directions go forward and backward through images, respectively. Other buttons are configurable under BUTTON_BINDINGS in the script file itself.  The script will print the button number being pressed to stdout if you need to know the number scheme for your gamepad/joystick, and want to remap the buttons for your gamepad (very likely as button id's vary from controller to controller).

The keyboard can be used as well. The keys can be remapped in the script file under KEY_BINDINGS. A complete list of all pygame key events can be found at http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html 

Default key bindings are: LEFT ARROW goes to previous image. RIGHT ARROW goes to next image. SPACE BAR selects. The MINUS key zooms out.  The EQUALS (unshifted plus) key zooms in. The ESCAPE key exits and closes the window.

The output file is simply a csv-format file (with header) listing all file paths for the selected images. The file is appended as each selection is made.
 
The score will be displayed in an animation, this can be shut off by setting animate to False

<input_dir>: A folder of pygame-compatible images (JPEGs by default)

<output_file>: A CSV file consisting of one column with header "Image". One record per *selected* image will be present in the file, in the style of:
Image
images\16769_37223_B_6_6.jpg
images\18959_42297_B_4_6.jpg
images\18959_42297_B_5_6.jpg


image_scorer.py
--------------
usage: image_scorer.py <input dir> <output file>

This script allows one to assign a score or other arbitrary value to each image in a directory.  It supports arbitrary key bindings defined in the scoreKeys dict.  By default, SPACE and 0 are defined as '0', and '1','2','3','4', and '5' are the scores 1 to 5, respectively. Arbitrary strings such as 'cancer' or 'normal' could also be bound to keys. 

This scoring script is designed to be flexible and useful for other purposes, however the primary purpose in this suite is to confirm the image investigated on the quick first pass has the subcellular localization pattern of interest.  If it does have the correct pattern, the buttons can be used to assign values such as strong, medium, weak or any other parameter.  We recommend making a key in a .txt file to refer to when doing the scoring.

We generally put 3,000 images in one folder and scan them in these smaller blocks.  After identifying all interesting images, we collate the output the CSV files into a single file.  We use MS Excel and the CONCATENATE command to convert 11513_29348_B_4_6.jpg into http://www.proteinatlas.org/images/11513/29348_B_4_6.jpg.  Note the first _ character becomes a / character in the final version. This can be also probably be done in R, Perl or Python.  This file is then sent back through HPASubC_image_download.py to download the subset of interesting images into a new folder.

<input_dir>: A folder of pygame-compatible images (JPEGs by default) A folder of downloaded .jpg images. Note: We use this HPASubC_image_scorer.py script directly in the image folder.

<output_file>: A CSV file with two columns: image and the assigned score in the style of:
Image,score
images\16385_37049_B_4_6.jpg,1
images\16385_37049_B_5_6.jpg,2
images\16385_37049_B_6_6.jpg,3

We use Excel and VLOOKUP commands to repopulate this file with ENSG ID values from early CSV files.  This can be done in R, Perl, Python or other languages.


get_gene_info_from_gene_list.py
--------------
usage: get_gene_info_from_gene_list.py <input_file> <output_file>

This is an optional script that returns the Gene name, gene description, and protein class from HPA for each gene in a gene list.

<input_file>: A text file list of ENGS IDs without a header in the style of: 
ENSG00000000003
ENSG00000000005
ENSG00000000419

<output_file>: A CSV file with a header and containing four columns.  Column 1 is the ENSGID.  Column 2 contains the Gene name. Column 3 is the gene description. Column 4 is the protein class. This is the format: 
ENSGID,Gene Name,Gene Description,Protein Class
ENSG00000000003,TSPAN6,Tetraspanin 6,Potential transmembrane proteins
ENSG00000000005,TNMD,Tenomodulin,Potential transmembrane proteins

get_protein_summary_from_gene_list.py
--------------

ENSG00000000005
ENSG00000000419

<output_file>:  A CSV file containing two columns.  Column one is the ENSGID.  Column 2 contains cell type data reporting either "Staining in X out of Y" or "Expressed in "X out of Y"  HPA has two different terminologies. This data can be added to a final report regarding the specificity/ubiquitousness of a protein. 


get_entrez_data_from_gene_list.py
--------------
usage: get_entrez_data_from_gene_list.py <input_file> <output_file> 
 
This is an optional script that will download parse information from HPA regarding the reported Entrez Gene Summary that provides initial information about each gene/protein identified.
